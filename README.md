# Pups Play

Pups Play helps fellow dog owners connect and find playmates for their favorite four-legged friends.

## Description

Pups Plays is a MERN (MongoDB-Express-React-Node.js) application with styling help from [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/).

Users must create a profile, username and password in order to use their app. Once logged in, users can search for other owners and their pups based on specific criteria and send messages to other users to set up a playdate.

## Demo
A live demo of the app can be found [here](https://pups-play.herokuapp.com/).
